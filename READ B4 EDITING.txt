Click button "set and go" to open the simulation stack. This is a simulation of reaction and diffusion of a catalytic reaction - CO oxidation - in a porous solid catalyst pellet.

WARNING: AFTER ANY CHANGES TO LIVECODE STACKS, MAKE SURE ALL STACKS ARE SAVED IN STACKFILEVERSION 2.7 ONLY.

This project was originally developed circa 2008. The C++ externals were compiled on OS of that era. Changes to the externals made in 2018+ may require significant changes to the project.

This stack sets the OS-dependent externals for stack "reactor pellet.rev" and then opens that stack.

This stack "reactor pellet.rev" and the external "arrayexample.dll" (Win) or "arrayexample.bundle" (Mac) should be in the same location on disk.
