# dynamic-CO-oxidation
Dynamic simulation of CO oxidation in a porous catalyst pellet built with LiveCode and C++ externals.

This project was built circa 2008 using a version of Runtime Revolution - now renamed LiveCode - and Mac and Win compilers of that era. 

The Rev/LiveCode stacks should be saved only with stackFileVersion 2.7.
