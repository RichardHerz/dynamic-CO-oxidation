This project was built circa 2008 using a version of Runtime Revolution - now renamed LiveCode - and Mac and Win compilers of that era. 

The Rev/LiveCode stacks should be saved only with stackFileVersion 2.7. 

To date, we have tested the project:

* On a Mac (MacBook Pro 2011) running Mac OS 10.13.2 (High Sierra) using LiveCode Community 8.1.8.
